# DTS Frontend-Backend Integration Summary

## ✅ What's Been Done

### Backend (Flask + AWS)
- ✅ Flask API server running on **port 5001**
- ✅ AWS Bedrock (Claude) integration for AI-powered route optimization
- ✅ CORS enabled for frontend communication
- ✅ All API endpoints functional and tested
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured in `.env` (gitignored)

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- ✅ React development server configured
- ✅ API service created (`src/services/api.ts`) to connect to Flask backend
- ✅ Route optimization form component created with full backend integration
- ✅ UI updated with proper layout for route optimization
- ✅ Frontend dependencies installed

### Project Structure
- ✅ Unified virtual environment at project root
- ✅ Single `requirements.txt` for all Python dependencies
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured to protect sensitive files
- ✅ README.md with complete setup instructions
- ✅ Quick start script (`start.sh`) for easy deployment

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Manual Start (Recommended for Development)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
cd backend
python3 app.py
```
Backend: http://localhost:5001

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Frontend: http://localhost:5173

### Option 2: Quick Start Script

```bash
./start.sh
```

This starts both backend and frontend automatically.

## 🔗 Integration Points

### API Endpoints Used by Frontend

1. **Health Check**
   - GET `/api/health`
   - Used to verify backend connection

2. **Route Optimization**
   - POST `/api/optimize-route`
   - Main feature - sends route data, receives AI-optimized recommendations
   - Request includes: userId, route (origin, destination, stops), deliveryWindow
   - Response includes: optimized route, metrics, AI recommendations, scores

3. **Request Management**
   - GET `/api/request/:requestId` - Get specific request
   - GET `/api/user/:userId/requests` - Get all user requests
   - POST `/api/request/:requestId/reoptimize` - Re-optimize existing route

4. **Route Validation**
   - POST `/api/validate-route`
   - Validates route before optimization

### Frontend Components

1. **RouteOptimizationForm** (`src/components/RouteOptimizationForm.tsx`)
   - Connects to backend `/api/optimize-route`
   - Displays AI recommendations from Claude
   - Shows metrics: distance, time, weather/traffic/sunlight scores
   - Demo route: SFO Airport → Santa Clara University

2. **API Service** (`src/services/api.ts`)
   - TypeScript interfaces matching backend response format
   - Fetch-based API calls with proper error handling
   - Base URL: `http://localhost:5001/api`

3. **App Layout** (`src/App.tsx`)
   - Route optimization form (integrates with backend)
   - Calendar for delivery window selection
   - Progress stepper for delivery tracking
   - Map visualization

## 📊 Data Flow

```
User Interaction (Frontend)
    ↓
RouteOptimizationForm
    ↓
apiService.optimizeRoute()
    ↓
HTTP POST to Flask Backend
    ↓
Flask routes data to AWS Bedrock (Claude)
    ↓
Claude generates optimization recommendations
    ↓
Flask sends response back to frontend
    ↓
Frontend displays results with metrics and recommendations
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Backend API:
```bash
cd backend
python3 test_api.py
```

### Test Frontend:
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Optimize Route with AI" button
3. Check browser console for API calls
4. Verify results display with Claude's recommendations

## 🎯 Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Add Input Forms**: Let users enter custom origin/destination
2. **Map Integration**: Display optimized route on the map
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for live route updates
4. **Authentication**: Add user login/registration
5. **History**: Show past optimization requests
6. **DynamoDB Integration**: Store and retrieve optimization history

## 📝 Important Notes

- Backend must be running before starting frontend
- `.env` file contains sensitive AWS credentials (gitignored)
- CORS is enabled for `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend runs in debug mode (not for production)
- Frontend has hot reload enabled for development

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ `.env` file gitignored
- ✅ AWS credentials not in version control
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ⚠️  Remember to rotate AWS credentials if they were previously exposed

---

**Status**: Both frontend and backend are fully integrated and ready to use! 🎉
