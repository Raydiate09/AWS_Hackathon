# Testing Smart Break Scheduling - Step-by-Step Guide

## üß™ Quick Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Long Haul Route with Morning Departure
**Purpose**: See strategic breaks during sunrise high-risk period

**Steps**:
1. **Origin**: New Orleans, LA (or type "New Orleans")
2. **Destination**: Santa Clara, CA (or type "Santa Clara University")
3. **Departure Time**: 
   - Check "Use Departure Time"
   - Select tomorrow's date
   - Set time to 6:00 AM
4. Click "Optimize Route with Driver Schedule"

**Expected Results**:
- ‚≠ê Look for **purple-highlighted** breaks with "Strategic" badge
- Morning breaks should overlap with sunrise (high sun glare risk)
- Check if breaks marked as "optimized for high-risk period"
- Safety score should be 85+

### Test 2: Cross-Country Route with Afternoon Start
**Purpose**: Test sunset optimization and 10-hour rest scheduling

**Steps**:
1. **Origin**: Los Angeles, CA
2. **Destination**: New York, NY
3. **Departure Time**:
   - Check "Use Departure Time"
   - Select tomorrow's date
   - Set time to 3:00 PM
4. Click "Optimize Route with Driver Schedule"

**Expected Results**:
- Multiple rest stops (10-hour rests) required
- At least one rest stop should be **optimized** (purple badge)
- Evening breaks should align with sunset risk periods
- Total elapsed time should be optimized vs non-optimized schedule

---

### Test 3: East-West Route (Maximum Sun Exposure)
**Purpose**: Maximum sunlight risk - driving directly into/away from sun

**Steps**:
1. **Origin**: San Francisco, CA
2. **Destination**: Las Vegas, NV
3. **Departure Time**:
   - Check "Use Departure Time"  
   - Select tomorrow's date
   - Set time to 7:00 AM (sunrise direction)
4. Click "Optimize Route with Driver Schedule"

**Expected Results**:
- High sunlight risk scores (70+) in segments
- Early morning break should be **Strategic** (purple)
- Break reason should mention "high-risk period"
- Safety waits may be converted to strategic breaks

---

### Test 4: Short Route (No Optimization Needed)
**Purpose**: Verify system doesn't over-optimize short trips

**Steps**:
1. **Origin**: San Jose, CA
2. **Destination**: San Francisco, CA
3. **No departure time** (use defaults)
4. Click "Optimize Route with Driver Schedule"

**Expected Results**:
- No breaks needed (trip < 8 hours)
- Schedule shows direct route
- No purple "Strategic" badges (not needed)
- Clean, simple schedule

## üîç What to Look For

### UI Indicators
‚úÖ **Regular Break** - White background, standard reason
```
‚òï Rest Stop
2:00 PM - 30 min
FMCSA required 30-minute break after 8 hours driving
```

‚úÖ **Optimized Strategic Break** - Purple background, special badge
```
‚òï Rest Stop                    ‚≠ê Strategic
11:30 AM - 30 min
Strategic break during high-risk period (risk: 75)
```

### Schedule Quality Metrics
- **Safety Score**: Should be 85+ for optimized schedules
- **Total Elapsed Time**: Should be ‚â§ sum of (driving + breaks + waits)
- **HOS Compliant**: Should always show ‚úÖ True
- **Meets Deadline**: Check if optimized schedule meets your target arrival

### Break/Rest Stop Details
- **Type**: 30_min_break, 10_hour_rest, or safety_wait
- **Optimized Flag**: Shows purple if true
- **Reason**: Explains why stop is needed
- **Risk Score**: Shows sunlight risk if applicable
- **Duration**: 30 min for breaks, 10 hours (600 min) for rest

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No "Strategic" Breaks Appearing
**Possible Causes**:
1. Route too short (< 8 hours) - no breaks needed
2. Departure time doesn't align with high-risk periods
3. Try morning (6-9 AM) or evening (4-7 PM) departure times

**Solution**: Use longer routes (8+ hours) with early morning or late afternoon departure

### All Breaks Look the Same
**Check**:
- Did you select a departure time? (Calendar integration required)
- Is route long enough to require multiple breaks?
- Try routes that cross multiple time zones

### Schedule Takes Long to Calculate
**Normal Behavior**: 
- Complex routes with many segments take 3-5 seconds
- System is calculating sun position for each segment
- Wait for blue "Optimizing driver schedule..." message to clear

## üìä Validation Checklist

After running a test, verify:

- [ ] **Driver Schedule section appears** (blue box)
- [ ] **Departure and arrival times shown**
- [ ] **Total driving time calculated**
- [ ] **Safety score displayed** (0-100)
- [ ] **HOS compliant status** (should be ‚úÖ True)
- [ ] **At least one break/rest if route > 8 hours**
- [ ] **Purple highlighting on optimized breaks** (long routes)
- [ ] **‚≠ê Strategic or ‚≠ê Optimized badge** visible
- [ ] **Warnings section shows optimization notices**

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Best Times to Test**: 6-9 AM or 4-7 PM departures show most optimization
2. **Long Routes**: 10+ hour routes show multiple strategic breaks
3. **Direction Matters**: East-West routes have higher sun exposure
4. **Check Warnings**: Optimization details appear in warning messages
5. **Compare Safety Scores**: Longer routes with optimization score higher

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

A successful test shows:
1. ‚úÖ At least one purple-highlighted "Strategic" break
2. ‚úÖ Safety score improves with optimization
3. ‚úÖ Total elapsed time is reasonable (not excessive waits)
4. ‚úÖ All HOS regulations still enforced
5. ‚úÖ Clear explanation of why breaks are optimized

**Happy Testing!** üöÄ

If you see purple "‚≠ê Strategic" badges on long-haul routes with morning/evening departures, the feature is working perfectly!
